    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    HTML 5 (formerly and commonly spelled HTML5[a]) is a software solution stack that defines the properties
    and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup based pattern to it.
    HTML 5 is the fifth and current major version of HTML, and subsumes XHTML. The current standard, the HTML Living Standard is
    developed by WHATWG, which is made up of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft),
    with the Living Standard also existing in an abridged version.
